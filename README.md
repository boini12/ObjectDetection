# Object Detection Model Training for project study at OTH Regensburg

The purpose of this project is to train to system with a "bad" and a really "good" dataset in order to compare the consequences of the choice of dataset that is used to train a model.

This should highlight the consequences for autonomous driving, if the dataset does not reflect the real world but only perfect images.
